Get overlapping SVs between technologies

We can get information about which SVs overlap between the different VCF files by using SURVIVOR. SURVIVOR is designed to merge VCF files of SVs from different individuals or species and it indicates which ones are present in all VCF files. We can use the same tool to compare the technologies and treat them as they were different individuals/samples. Several parameters can be used to tune the merging.

# link the VFC files
ln -s ../Sniffles/PacBio/SV_PB_filtered_gaps.vcf .
ln -s ../Sniffles/Nanopore/SV_ONT_filtered_gaps.vcf .
ln -s ../Manta/SV_IL_filtered_gaps.vcf .

# list the VCF files to merge
ls SV*.vcf > list_vcf

SURVIVOR merge list_vcf 1000 1 1 0 0 50 merged_filtered.vcf

Here the filtering parameters of SURVIVOR are the following:

Max distance between breakpoints: 1000

Minimum number of supporting caller: 1

Take the type into account (1==yes, else no): 1

Take the strands of SVs into account (1==yes, else no): 0

Estimate distance based on the size of SV (1==yes, else no): 0

Minimum size of SVs to be taken into account: 50

Inspect the output file merged_filtered.vcf.


Plot the comparisons

Code from: https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/SURVIVOR/wiki#plotting-the-comparison-of-multiple-input-vcf-files-after-merging

Extract the overlap information like this:

perl -ne 'print "$1\n" if /SUPP_VEC=([^,;]+)/' merged_filtered.vcf | sed -e 's/\(.\)/\1 /g' > merged_filtered_overlapp.txt
